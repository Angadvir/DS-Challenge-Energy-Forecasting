# DS-Challenge-Energy-Forecasting
This is a DS Challenge involving making in-sample and out-of-sample predictions for Energy levels (kwh) using ML forecasting techniques in Python.

To view the results of the implemented ML models, please view the "AG_DS_Challenge_Final_HTML_RESULTS.html" containing the results and explanation of the ML models and methodolgies utilized in obtaining the results. The file contains a comprehensive explanation of the analysis perfomed at each stage of the code and the 'key findings' observed at the concluding section of the report. 

To run the code, please download the data-set file, "load_temperature_data.csv" and the jupyter notebook file, "AG_DataS_Challenge_Final.ipynb", which contains the code. 

You may have to install a few python packages to run the code, such as "LightGBM", "ARIMA", etc. depending on your pre-installations. 
Alternatively, you can play around with the code and run simpler models instead. 

Thanks.
